# 🔍 DMFinder
A utility website to find closed Discord chats!
A live version can be found [here](https://dmfinder.vercel.app/).

## 🗣️ How does it work?
DMFinder works by scanning your discord data package. The data package contains all messages that you sent. DMFinder lets you search for old messages that you sent. Once you entered your query, DMFinder will show you all chats in which you said that word.

## ❓ FAQ
### 📥 How do I get my data package?
You can request it in the settings under the `Privacy & Safety` section. Once you are there, you will have to scroll all the way down where you can request it.
### 🔐 How do I ensure that my data is safe?
Firstly, once the website is loaded, it can be fully used with your internet connection turned off, ensuring that no data will be sent to a server. You can even safe the site using your browser (`Right click > Save Page as...`) and then manually open it. Additionally you can also check the source code.
